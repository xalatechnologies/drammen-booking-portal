all interactions with DB/supabase should happen via BaseRepository, DAL and Zustand.

When creating new components / code, Always keep localization in mind.

Make sure to start plan with a thoroguh review of current status, current codebase and implementation, the database structure and models, the supabase edge functions and all related code in the codebase, also add a step for looking into the requirements of the application and the context of the project. At the end of the plan add a clean up process to remove all redundant and unused code that the AI might have generated, and clean build and lint.
Always use aliases for imports and exports and relative paths. Add aliases to the tsconfig.json file.

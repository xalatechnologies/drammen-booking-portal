## Architecture and Design Principles

### SOLID Principles Application

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - [ ] Separate components by functionality (facility details, images, zones, opening hours)
  - [ ] Each component should have only one reason to change
  - [ ] Create focused service classes that handle specific domains

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
  - [ ] Design components to be extendable without modifying existing code
  - [ ] Use interface-based design for repositories and services
  - [ ] Implement strategy patterns for features likely to change (pricing rules, availability calculation)

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
  - [ ] Ensure derived classes can substitute base classes without altering behavior
  - [ ] Implement consistent interfaces across repository implementations

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
  - [ ] Create focused interfaces rather than general-purpose ones
  - [ ] Split large interfaces into smaller, specific ones for different client needs

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
  - [ ] High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
  - [ ] Implement dependency injection for services and repositories

### Clean Architecture

- [ ] Separate concerns into distinct layers:
  - Presentation (UI components, pages)
  - Application (services, coordinators)
  - Domain (business rules, models)
  - Infrastructure (repositories, external services)

- [ ] Ensure unidirectional dependencies (inner layers shouldn't know about outer layers)

## Repository Pattern Implementation

### Facility Repository

```typescript
// Standard repository interface
export interface IFacilityRepository {
  getFacilities(pagination: PaginationParams, filters: FacilityFilters, sorting: SortingParams): Promise<PaginatedResult<Facility>>;
  getFacilityById(id: string | number): Promise<Facility | null>;
  createFacility(facility: Partial<Facility>): Promise<Facility>;
  updateFacility(id: string | number, facility: Partial<Facility>): Promise<Facility>;
  deleteFacility(id: string | number): Promise<boolean>;
  
  // Additional facility-specific methods
  getFacilityZones(facilityId: string | number): Promise<Zone[]>;
  getFacilityImages(facilityId: string | number): Promise<FacilityImage[]>;
  getFacilityOpeningHours(facilityId: string | number): Promise<OpeningHours[]>;
  getFacilityBlackoutPeriods(facilityId: string | number): Promise<BlackoutPeriod[]>;
  getFacilityPricingRules(facilityId: string | number): Promise<PricingRule[]>;
}
```

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Create base repository abstract class with common methods
- [ ] Implement concrete repositories:
  - [ ] `SupabaseFacilityRepository` - Primary implementation
  - [ ] `MockFacilityRepository` - For development/testing 

- [ ] Create specialized repositories for facility sub-entities:
  - [ ] `FacilityZoneRepository`
  - [ ] `FacilityImageRepository`
  - [ ] `FacilityOpeningHoursRepository`
  - [ ] `FacilityBlackoutPeriodRepository`
  - [ ] `FacilityPricingRuleRepository`

- [ ] Implement repository factory for dependency injection

### Standard Repository Methods

For each entity type, implement standardized methods:

- [ ] `getAll(pagination, filters, sorting)`
- [ ] `getById(id)`
- [ ] `create(entity)`
- [ ] `update(id, entity)`
- [ ] `delete(id)`
- [ ] `bulkCreate(entities)`
- [ ] `bulkUpdate(entities)`
- [ ] `bulkDelete(ids)`

## State Management Strategy

### Zustand Stores

- [ ] Create specialized stores for different facility aspects:

```typescript
// Example store structure
export const useFacilityStore = create<FacilityState>((set, get) => ({
  facilities: [],
  currentFacility: null,
  isLoading: false,
  error: null,
  pagination: { page: 1, limit: 10, total: 0 },
  filters: { status: 'all', type: 'all', search: '' },
  
  // Actions
  actions: {
    fetchFacilities: async (pagination, filters) => {
      set({ isLoading: true });
      try {
        const result = await facilityService.getFacilities(pagination, filters);
        set({ 
          facilities: result.data, 
          pagination: { ...get().pagination, total: result.pagination.total },
          isLoading: false 
        });
      } catch (error) {
        set({ error, isLoading: false });
      }
    },
    // Other actions...
  }
}));
```

- [ ] Implement specialized stores:
  - [ ] `useFacilityStore` - Main facility management
  - [ ] `useFacilityFormStore` - Form state management
  - [ ] `useFacilityZoneStore` - Zone management
  - [ ] `useFacilityImageStore` - Image management
  - [ ] `useFacilityCalendarStore` - Calendar and availability

### React Query Integration

- [ ] Configure React Query for data fetching and caching:

```typescript
// Example query hooks
export const useFacilitiesQuery = (pagination, filters, sorting) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['facilities', pagination, filters, sorting],
    queryFn: () => facilityService.getFacilities(pagination, filters, sorting),
    keepPreviousData: true,
  });
};
```

- [ ] Implement query invalidation strategy for CRUD operations
- [ ] Configure optimistic updates for better UX
- [ ] Define proper cache management policies

### Form State Management

- [ ] Use React Hook Form with Zod for validation
- [ ] Implement multi-step form state persistence
- [ ] Create custom hooks for form sections with validation logic

## UI Components and Design System

### Component Hierarchy

- [ ] Design comprehensive component hierarchy:
  - Pages (top-level views)
  - Layout components (structure)
  - Feature components (functional units)
  - UI components (reusable elements)

### Shadcn UI Implementation

- [ ] Use consistent Shadcn UI components across all admin views
- [ ] Create specialized variants for common use cases
- [ ] Ensure proper theming and style consistency

### Standard UI Components

- [ ] Tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
  - [ ] FacilityTable
  - [ ] ZoneTable
  - [ ] BookingsTable
  
- [ ] Forms and inputs
  - [ ] StandardForm
  - [ ] FormSection
  - [ ] InputWithValidation
  - [ ] ImageUpload
  - [ ] DateRangePicker

- [ ] Cards and containers
  - [ ] DataCard
  - [ ] StatsCard
  - [ ] ContentSection

- [ ] Navigation and layout
  - [ ] TabNavigation
  - [ ] Breadcrumbs
  - [ ] ActionBar

### UI Component Checklist

- [ ] Create reusable UI components for:
  - [ ] Form sections
  - [ ] Data tables with filters
  - [ ] Detail views
  - [ ] Card-based UIs
  - [ ] Modal dialogs
  - [ ] Custom selects and dropdowns
  - [ ] Date and time pickers
  - [ ] Image galleries
  - [ ] Status indicators

## Localization Strategy

### Translation Structure

- [ ] Organize translations in a hierarchical structure:

```typescript
// Example structure
const translations = {
  en: {
    admin: {
      facilities: {
        management: "Facilities Management",
        pageDescription: "Manage facility information, availability and settings",
        addNew: "Add New Facility",
        search: {
          placeholder: "Search facilities...",
          noResults: "No facilities found matching your criteria."
        },
        filters: {
          type: "Type",
          status: "Status",
          // etc.
        },
        form: {
          // Form-specific translations
        },
        // etc.
      }
    }
  },
  no: {
    // Norwegian translations
  }
};
```

### Translation Implementation

- [ ] Use the translation hook consistently:

```typescript
const { t, tSync } = useTranslation();

// Usage
<Button>{tSync("admin.facilities.addNew", "Add New Facility")}</Button>
```

### Localization Tasks

- [ ] Define complete translation namespaces for facility management:
  - [ ] `admin.facilities.common` - Common terms
  - [ ] `admin.facilities.form` - Form labels and messages
  - [ ] `admin.facilities.validation` - Validation messages
  - [ ] `admin.facilities.operations` - Action and operation messages
  - [ ] `admin.facilities.notifications` - Success/error notifications

- [ ] Create translation files for supported languages:
  - [ ] English (default/fallback)
  - [ ] Norwegian

- [ ] Implement translation loading strategy:
  - [ ] Lazy-load translations by namespace
  - [ ] Preload common translations

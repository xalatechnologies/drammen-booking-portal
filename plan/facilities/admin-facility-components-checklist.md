This document provides a detailed implementation checklist for the specific components of the admin facility management system, following SOLID principles and best practices.

## Core Components Implementation

### 1. Repository Layer

export const useFacilityStore = create<FacilityState>((set) => ({
  facilities: [],
  isLoading: false,
  error: null,
  actions: {
    // Actions using the service layer
    fetchFacilities: async () => {/* implementation */},
    createFacility: async () => {/* implementation */},
    updateFacility: async () => {/* implementation */},
    deleteFacility: async () => {/* implementation */},
  }
}));
```

- [ ] Implement form state stores with validation:
```typescript
export const useFacilityFormStore = create<FacilityFormState>((set) => ({
  formData: initialFormState,
  validation: { isValid: false, errors: {} },
  isDirty: false,
  actions: {
    updateField: (field, value) => {/* implementation */},
    validateForm: () => {/* implementation */},
    resetForm: () => {/* implementation */},
    submitForm: async () => {/* implementation */},

  "pageDescription": "Manage facility information, availability and settings",
  "list": {
    "title": "All Facilities",
    "addNew": "Add New Facility",
    "search": {
      "placeholder": "Search facilities..."
    },
    // more translations...
  },
  "form": {
    "title": {
      "new": "Add New Facility",
      "edit": "Edit Facility"
    },
    "sections": {
      "basic": {
        "title": "Basic Information",
        // field labels...
      },

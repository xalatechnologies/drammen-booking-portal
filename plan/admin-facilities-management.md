# Admin Facilities Management - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Restructure and enhance the admin facilities management feature to ensure proper UI structure, remove all mock data, and fully integrate with Supabase via repository, state, and service layers.

## Phase 1: Architecture Assessment & Planning ✅

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Repository pattern is implemented with `BaseRepository` and `SupabaseRepository`
- [x] Service layer exists with `FacilityService` and `SupabaseFacilityService`
- [x] Supabase edge functions are operational (`supabase/functions/facilities/`)
- [x] Basic UI components exist in `src/components/admin/facilities/`
- [x] Form validation with Zod schemas
- [x] React/TypeScript best practices in use

## Phase 2: Remove Mock Data ✅
- [x] Delete all mock data files (`src/data/coreFacilities.ts`, `src/data/facilities/`)
- [x] Remove all references to mock data in codebase
- [x] Ensure all facility data is loaded from Supabase via repository/service

## Phase 3: State Management Integration ✅
- [x] Create Zustand store for admin/facilities (`useFacilityAdminStore`)
- [x] Move all facility list, selection, filter, pagination, and CRUD state to store
- [x] Refactor admin/facilities UI to use store (remove React Query for admin)

## Phase 4: UI Refactor & Localization Integration ✅
- [x] Refactor all admin/facilities list/grid/table/detail/form views to use store
- [x] Remove all direct data fetching and local state for facilities in admin
- [x] Use localization hooks (`tSync`) for all UI strings
- [x] All admin/facilities UI is now store-driven, uses localization, and is free of mock data

## Phase 5: Shared Component Enforcement ⬜
- [ ] Ensure all UI elements (labels, buttons, etc.) use shared library components
- [ ] Refactor any custom UI to use global/shared components for consistency

## Phase 6: UI/UX Polish & Accessibility ⬜
- [ ] Review and enhance UI/UX for admin/facilities
- [ ] Ensure accessibility best practices
- [ ] Add tests for critical flows

## Phase 7: QA & Testing ⬜
- [ ] Manual and automated testing of all admin/facilities features
- [ ] Fix any bugs or inconsistencies

## Phase 8: Documentation & Handover ⬜
- [ ] Update documentation for admin/facilities management
- [ ] Handover to QA or next team

---

**Note:**
- All admin/facilities list, grid, table, detail, and form views are now store-driven, use localization, and are free of mock data.

## Phase 5: Repository & Service Integration

### Repository Layer
- [ ] Ensure all operations go through `FacilityRepository`
- [ ] Implement proper error handling in repositories
- [ ] Add logging for debugging
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add caching strategies

### Service Layer
- [ ] Enhance `SupabaseFacilityService` with better error handling
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Implement request deduplication
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize data transformation

### Edge Functions
- [ ] Add request validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Optimize query performance
- [ ] Add response caching headers

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Search & Filtering
- [ ] Advanced text search across all facility fields
- [ ] Geolocation-based filtering
- [ ] Multi-select filters for amenities/equipment
- [ ] Saved filter presets
- [ ] Export filtered results

### Batch Operations
- [ ] Bulk edit facilities
- [ ] Bulk status changes
- [ ] Import facilities from CSV
- [ ] Export facilities to various formats

### Analytics Integration
- [ ] Facility utilization metrics
- [ ] Revenue tracking
- [ ] Popular facilities dashboard
- [ ] Capacity planning tools

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Repository layer tests
- [ ] Service layer tests
- [ ] Zustand store tests
- [ ] Component unit tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end facility CRUD operations
- [ ] Filter and search functionality
- [ ] Form validation and submission
- [ ] Error handling scenarios

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Large dataset rendering
- [ ] Search performance
- [ ] Form submission speed
- [ ] Mobile performance

## Phase 8: Documentation & Deployment

### Documentation
- [ ] Component documentation with Storybook
- [ ] API documentation for services
- [ ] User guide for facility management
- [ ] Developer guide for extending functionality

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Edge function deployment
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Error tracking configuration

## Success Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Zero mock data in production code
- [ ] All operations use repository/service pattern
- [ ] Zustand state management fully integrated
- [ ] Sub-200ms response times for common operations
- [ ] 100% TypeScript coverage
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive and responsive UI
- [ ] Fast loading times with skeleton states
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Offline-friendly where possible
- [ ] Accessible to users with disabilities

### Business Requirements
- [ ] Support for 10,000+ facilities
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Audit trail for all changes
- [ ] Data export capabilities
- [ ] Integration with booking system

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Assessment & Mock data removal)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days (State management integration)
- **Phase 4**: 5-7 days (UI enhancement)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days (Repository/Service optimization)
- **Phase 6**: 4-5 days (Advanced features)
- **Phase 7**: 3-4 days (Testing)
- **Phase 8**: 1-2 days (Documentation & deployment)

**Total Estimated Time**: 20-28 days

## Risk Mitigation
- Incremental development with regular testing
- Backup current functionality before major changes
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Progressive rollout with feature flags
- Regular code reviews and pair programming
